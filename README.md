# RoadRules

A simple and modern web platform to learn traffic rules and prepare for the driving license theory exam.

## 🎯 Idea

Users learn driving theory step by step:

- Lessons are ordered and divided into sections
- Each lesson ends with a test
- Users must pass tests to unlock the next lesson
- Progress is saved in the user account

---

## ✨ Planned Features

- User registration and login
- Structured lessons
- Lesson tests (10 questions)
- Section tests (20 questions)
- Final exam to check readiness
- Recommendations for weak topics
- Progress tracking

- **Backend:** Python (Django or FastAPI)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / SQLite
